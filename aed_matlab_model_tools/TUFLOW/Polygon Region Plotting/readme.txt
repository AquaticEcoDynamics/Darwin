Changes to how the script is executed

No need to edit plottfv_polygon to add your config to the switch. Simply enter the config file name when executing:

For the configs/Peel_SAL.m configuration

plottfv_polygon Peel_SAL

As long as your config script is in the configs directory or in the same directory as plottfv_polygon.m it will work.
